# CSCI-331-4-Group-9, Sudoku Solver



Designed by Katie Osias, Evan Albrecht, and Carter Howell



This project is designed to display a playable Sudoku Board in pygame and compare the efficiency of two different agents solving the board. One uses a backtracking algorithm and the other, a CSP enhanced backtracking algorithm using forward checking. The board can be reset with the 'R' key.
